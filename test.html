                    Steller's sea cow, discovered in 1741 and gone extinct in 1768, was one of the few megafaunal species gone extinct. Megafauna means an animal above a cerntain weight. There are several categories: the megaherbivoes (larger than 1000 kg). There are the megacarnivores (bigger than 100 kg), as well as ocean megafauna. Steller's sea cow was estimated to be at around 4000kg and was hunted to extinction by humans.

The longest surviving elephant bird species, survived until roughly 1560-1300 years ago.

Scientists have recently analyzed this specie's genome and concluded that the bird's rapid decline whose that human interference drove their extinction. Scientists take considerate interest in this species because it is one of 'the top candidates for de-extinction' (Britannica). This means that there would be a process in which DNA is taken from the specimens and used to 'recreate' the extinct species."

The people ate these pigeons in large amounts, but they were also killed because they were believed to pose a threat to agriculture. By the 1870s, the decrease in this bird population was already dramatic. It was later classified as extinct on September 1st, 1914, when the last individual in captivity at the Cincinnati zoo died."
