    <p>
    The scientific method is a method for finding ideas and testing theories. It is not the simple ladder of steps we are
    taught in elementary school, but is a process of searching for evidence and information, testing ideas, checking the
    outcomes of the experiments, and receiving feedback. These are very fluid and can flow in any order. Science is not
    conducted on opinions and the purpose of science is to search for facts. The system of science is a system of finding
    facts and testing ideas in the pursuit of finding more facts. Science is the pursuit of knowledge and truth and until
    people realize this, they will still continue to doubt the conclusions of scientists. Scientific theories and arguments
    are built on the standard of claim, evidence, and reasoning. The scientist starts off with a claim, such as the claim
    that humans are causing extinction, and then proceeds to the most important part, the evidence. Evidence can take many
    forms, from scientific documents to experiments, and is data that is taken or found to support the claim. The evidence
    is the part that is the most misunderstood.Evidence is not opinions or beliefs, but is cold hard factual data. The
    reasoning portion of a scientific argument is the scientistâ€™s explanation of why the data is correct and the processes
    they used to validate the data.</p>
