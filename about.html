                <h3>Who we are, what we stand for</h3>
                <p>After much work, we present, our website! But you should also get to know us. <br>
                This website was created by Ilan Elfen, Noah Mullis, and Devin Manrrique, who put love and effort into this. Around a month ago, we were prompted to create a product which improved the scientific literacy of those around us. We chose to talk about extinction deniers. Instead of just making a simple video or a Google Sites website, we decided to make a website from scratch. By learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a small amount of php, this website took a long time to make. The website itself was made and designed entirely by Ilan Elfen, as well as the video editing, the simulation was made by Devin Manrrique, who also wrote the content inside this webiste, and Noah Mullis beautifully wrote and edited all the text in this website.

                <h3>Ilan</h3>
                <p>Ilan, a 9th grader from Swtizerland, is the master codesmith and the driving force behind the project and website, which he has created from scratch.
                He enjoys science fiction books, although most of his time in the past few days has been spent trying to figure out what
                a website was and designing it so that it doesn't look like it was created in the â€˜90s. He also edited the videos and
                made a script which we later decided would not be used.</p>
                <h3>Noah</h3>
                <p>Noah is a 9th grader from Alabama who enjoys school, hanging out with his friends, reading, and eating. He is the
                mastermind of the scientific method and plays a key role in the research of this project, as well as designing the
                website.</p>
                <h3>Devin</h3>
                <p>Devin is also a 9th grader and is from the midwest and is the pioneer of the simulation and the aspiring video editor
                looking to create better content to the website. He has helped write questions to asked Dr Wootton from the University of Chicago on the subject of extinction and ecosystems</p>
