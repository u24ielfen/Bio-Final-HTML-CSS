            What does extinction mean?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Extinction is when every individual of an animal or plant species dies out. Extinction has become a major crisis
            especially now in history as species are dying out at alarming rates. Humans have encouraged this heightened rate of
            extinction by “hunting, overharvesting, introducing invasive species to the wild, polluting, and changing wetlands and
            forests to croplands and urban areas” (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/extinct-species#:~:text=Extinction%20happens%20when%20environmental%20factors,a%20species%20to%20die%20out.&text=Humans%20also%20cause%20other%20species,to%20croplands%20and%20urban%20areas"
                target="_blank">National Geographic</a>).The main concern these days is habitat destruction, which is changing animal’s habitats into human habitats and
                destroying the animal’s homes. As humans encroach on animal’s lands, the animals are forced into smaller and smaller
                areas or are forced to come face to face with humans. As humans encroach on animal’s lands, the animals are forced into
                smaller and smaller areas or are forced to come face to face with humans. We see that if you put animals (including
                humans) in a habitat that is shrinking, they will become more and more desperate to escape as the habitat gets closer
                and closer to being too small and the animal gets closer and closer to being crushed. This has been shown in many movies
                including Star Wars with the trash compactor scene (Episode 4, A New Hope). As the walls of the trash compactor move in,
                Han, Luke, and Leia become increasingly desperate to get out and Luke’s calls for help become higher pitched and convey
                more urgency. Situations like this, but in the real world, often end up with scared animals, sometimes large animals
                running amok, terrified, in urban areas.
                <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-land-ecosystems-ecology-intact-species"
                target="">ScienceNews</a> states that “Only 3 percent of Earth’s land hasn’t been marred by humans” and
            yet
            some people still
            do not believe that humans are pushing species to extinction. ScienceNews also noted that “Thanks to human
            activities,
            the rate of global species extinctions is tens to hundreds of times faster than the average extinction rate
            was
            over the
            last 10 million years.” <br><Br>

        <h3 id="scientists"> How do scientists decide if a species is extinct?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.iucn.org/">The International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) is the
            agency
            that monitors the populations of
            endangered animals on a global scale. This agency has a large variety of sources it uses to get information
            about these
            animal populations. They work with conservationists, biologists, and statisticians to try to get an idea of
            how
            each
            species is doing. Using many different techniques, technology, and teams of people, scientists record
            information about
            species they are concerned about. A species whose population drops by 70% in a decade is listed as
            endangered. A
            species
            whose population decreases by 90% in a decade is listed as critically endangered.

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 id="controversy"> What is the controversy behind extinction?
        </h3>
        <p>One of the reasons people deny extinction is that there are a very low confirmed number of extinctions every
            year. The
            last 40 years have seen an average extinction rate of about 2 species per year, and of those, not all are
            declared
            extinct on the IUCN Red List. They have been declared extinct (even by IUCN itself) but the list has not yet
            been
            updated. Going even deeper with the IUCN, they state that “the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species notes
            that
            36% of the
            47,677 species assessed are threatened with extinction, which represents 21% of mammals, 30% of amphibians,
            12%
            of
            birds, 28% of reptiles, 37% of freshwater fishes, 70% of plants, and 35% of invertebrates.”
            ““In the last 40 years, the average annual extinction rate was two per year,” he wrote. “Not 2,000. Not 200.
            Two. The
            most recent decadal data available was from 2000 to 2009 and only four extinctions were reported in that
            time
            frame.”
            Sorry to burst your bubble, Gregory, but that’s just the way science works. Species don’t get declared
            extinct
            very
            quickly, and the IUCN Red List doesn’t list every single described species, let alone every extinct one. Of
            the
            four
            extinctions I’ve reported on this year (that’s more than your “average” rate of two, by the way), only half
            appear on
            the IUCN Red List, and one of them is still listed there as “critically endangered.””(The Revelator)

        <h3 id="deniers">What does science suggest about “extinction deniers”?
        </h3>
        <p>In an interview with Dr. Tim Wootton, a professor in the department of ecology and evolution at the
            University of
            Chicago He stated that “There have been measurements of extinction rates in recent times based on historical
            records and
            this has been translated into an estimated rate of extinction. And then compared to invertebrates from the
            fossil
            record.” He also stated that. ”Evidence is that rates of extinction in the current period are as high as
            some of
            the
            larger mass extinction rates.” And noted that “Unlike some of the past events we don’t have meteors crashing
            to
            the
            earth or things like that.” We do have a sense of why a lot of documented extinctions have occurred. Through
            habitat
            loss and overhunting. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>How do humans cause extinction?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Humans over the years have started to become a leading cause of extinction. We have destroyed land, hunted animals, and
            many more things. Over many studies over time, we can see that humans have reshaped 75% of land on earth and many parts
            of the ocean, for our own benefit and not thinking of the animals. Overall about 1 million plants and animals have gone
            extinct, many within just decades. Humans also do very little for conservation to help the endangered animals. The New
            York Times states “With the human population passing 7 billion, activities like farming, logging, poaching, fishing and
            mining are altering the natural world at a rate “unprecedented in human history.” “, just going farther into depth of
            how much humans have done to raise the extinction rates every day.
            
            There are many reasons that humans would doubt that they are causing extinction, but the main one is disinformation.
            Recently, multiple sources have been put out that state that extinction rates are normal and that there is no reason to
            be concerned about this widespread death. Extinction deniers also point out that there are a very low level of confirmed
            extinct species, but the simple fact is that it is very hard to confirm a species as extinct. All it takes is 1 picture
            to say that the animal is not extinct, but it takes days of surveying, searching, and investigating to declare a species
            as extinct.
            
            This is important because extinction is a double edged sword. If one species goes extinct, it often leads to more
            species going extinct and sometimes, in extreme cases, it can lead to the extinction of an entire ecosystem. Every
            extinct animal is another animal we cannot learn from and another ecosystem that is getting closer to collapse. We must
            realize this as the horror that it is and if we don’t our grandchildren or their grandchildren might live in a world
            with no rhinos, no elephants, no wolves, and none of the other iconic animals that we live with today.
